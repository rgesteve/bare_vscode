A very basic extension that makes use of webviews to render a d3 chart.

## Develop

### Setting up

To get started with this codebase it's useful to create a `node`-based development environment.  One way to do this is through a [`conda` environment](https://www.anaconda.com/), which is the method outlined below.  Here are the steps (tested on Windows and Linux):

1. [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. Enter the anaconda environment and create a `conda` environment (denoted in this example as having name *bare_vscode*):
```
       > [PATH_TO_ANACONDA_INSTALLATION]\Scripts\activate.bat    # On Windows
(base) > conda create -n bare_vscode python=3.6  # the actual version of python is not too important
```
3. "Activate" (start using) the environment:
```
(base)        > activate bare_vscode
(bare_vscode) > 
```
4. Install the `node` stack in the environment:
```
(bare_vscode) > conda install nodejs
```
5. In the directory where you've cloned this repo (at the level where the `package.json` file sits) install the dependencies
```
(bare_vscode) > cd [PATH_TO_THIS_CLONE]
(bare_vscode) > npm install
```

6. To build the contents of the webview, you'll need to run `webpack`:
```
(bare_vscode) > npx webpack
```
If you get some errors, you're probably using the wrong branch, please make sure that `webpack-cli` is in "package.json"

7. Open Visual Studio Code (heretofore "vsc") and start working with the extension as described in the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/overview)
```
(bare_vscode) > code .
```

### Code Architecture

This extension only contains the "front end" to have vsc communicate with VTune.  The logic to locate, invoke and process VTune output is in a [separate codebase](https://github.com/rgesteve/ExternalProfilerDriver).
